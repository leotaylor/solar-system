# Description 
Single page app that dispalys 9 cards, one for each planet of the solar system (yes, Pluto is a planet). Once the user clicks on a planet card, the 9 planet cards are replaced by one large card for the selected planet that displays facts about the planet. There is also a search bar that can be used to select the planet.
